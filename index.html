        <p>My name is Robert Down and I am running for FNSA President. I am a 28-year old, junior nursing student
            with a passion for helping others and a drive for excellence in all that I do. Allow me to tell you a bit
            about myself, and why I am running for president.</p>
        <p>Nursing school has impacted my life in countless ways. I look back at the person I was just a few months ago
            during Intro to Nursing and wonder how I could have grown so much, so fast. I have seen my passion for emerging and
            developing populations become an integral part of who I am.</p>
        <p>With a background in IT and a heart for those in need I have contributed software to OpenEMR, a royalty-free
            EMR solution deployed to over 115,000 practioners throughout the world. In January of this year I was elected
            to the Board of Directors for OEMR, the non-profit behind OpenEMR. I am now the secretary of this international,
            very diverse board working to bring together a broad range of ideas into a cohesive action plan.</p>
        <p>I believe every life is sacred. This basic assumption guides my beliefs regarding war, famine, poverty, foreign
            and domestic aid, as well as aid within my own local community. I struggle to understand the relentless wars
            waged around the world, or the fact that a wide majority of the world lives in poverty. And while I know
            it is unrealistic to think I can end poverty, homelessness, or human trafficking by myself, I am convicted
            to help those most at-risk. To that end, I am currently a Disaster Action Team Lead for the American Red Cross
            responding to house fires, natrual disasters, and national tragedies.</p>
        <p>Access to health care is a fundamental human right, and one aspect that defines the essence of humanity is the
            fact that we don't simply leave the sick or wounded behind to die; we come together as a collective to ensure
            those in need are granted a fighting chance. Embracing the role of an advocate, I have learned to use my
            voice to speak for those who may otherwise remain voiceless. I have also developed a considerable passion
            for informatics and developing license-free electronic medical records software for providers in developing
            countries. Focusing on the intersection of my information technology skills, role as a nurse-advocate, and
            empathy for emerging populations has helped me to become a more influential healthcare professional.</p>

                <p>I am writing to express my wholehearted support for Robert Down’s application to the position of President of the Florida Nursing Student Association. As Robert’s direct supervisor at the American Red Cross, I have had the privilege of witnessing his compassion, dedication, and true belief in the mission of the American Red Cross. I have been impressed with his initiative in taking on roles with increasing responsibility, his work ethic and desire to assist in any manner he is able to, and his ability to remain positive regardless of the situation. Robert has become a valued leader within the American Red Cross Disaster Action Team, and I’m confident that he would bring his many skills and infectious positivity with him to the position as President of the Florida Nursing Student Association.</p>
